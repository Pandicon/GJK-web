option 1:
```sh
add_user.py <mail> <name> <perms>
```
or
option 2:
```sh
add_user.py a 0 0 --list
```

option 1 adds a new user with specified mail, name and perms. If you set the name to `0`, it will be replaced by `NULL` instead.
option 2 lists all data in the user database. (a 0 0 are just unused mail, name and perms fields)
